# Dashboard

We have to create our own Dashboard with some widgets and services (Google, Steam, Github, Office 365, etc.). This project allow us to discover new language and tools through the creation and use of a web service.

> Dashboard is a user interface that, somewhat resembling an automobile's dashboard, organizes and presents information in a > way that is easy to read. However, a computer dashboard is more likely to be interactive than an automobile dashboard
> (unless it is also computer-based). To some extent, most graphical user interfaces (GUIs) resemble a dashboard. However,
> some product developers consciously employ this metaphor (and sometimes the term) so that the user instantly recognizes
> the similarity.
